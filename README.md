This project is designed to search for a Hamiltonian cycle in graphs. 
The algorithm searches for Hamiltonian cycles in graphs that satisfy the sufficient conditions of Dirac and Ore for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. Additionally, if a weighted graph is passed, a fairly optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem can be obtained.
